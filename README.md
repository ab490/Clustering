# Clustering
Analyzing the following Clustering Techniques: Kmeans, GMM and DBSCAN.

I am given the mnist-tsne-train.csv and mnist-tsne-test.csv files. The train file mnist-tsne-train.csv contain 1000, 2-dimensional data which include 100 examples for each of the 10 classes. Third column is the class information. Similarly mnist-tsne-test.csv contain 500, 2-dimensional data which include 50 examples for each of the 10 classes. \
Task here is to partition (cluster) the training data into 10 clusters using different clustering techniques.
